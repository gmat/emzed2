Why did we develop emzed ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When we started to develop LCMS analysis workflows we discovered that most of the exisiting
frameworks and software belong to one of the following opposite categories:

* Our goal was to develop a framework which combines the positive aspects of two extremes:
  One the one side there exist fast and **flexible** frameworks, but in languages as C++ which only
  can be used efficiently by experienced programmers. One the other side *GUI* based applications
  are simple to use and learn but hard to adapt.

* The invention of programming environments as *Matlab* and *R* leveraged the productivity of
  mathematicians and scientists from other fields. We try to introduce this concept for analyzing
  LCMS data.

  *emzed* is based on Spyder [spyderlib]_ for providing the IDE and [guiqwt]_ and [guidata]_ for
  plotting.

* Instead of reinventing the wheel we cherry pick algorithms from established libraries and
  frameworks as [OpenMS]_ and [XCMS]_. These are wrapped behind a **consistent application
  programming interface (API)** and thus *emzed* based workflows reduce manual and error prone
  import and export steps.
