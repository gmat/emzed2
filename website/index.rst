What is emzed ?
---------------

  *emzed* is an open source framework for rapid and interactive development of
  LCMS data analysis workflows in `Python <http://www.python.org>`_.


What does this mean ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  *emzed* makes experimenting with new analysis strategies for LCMS data as simple as possible.


Fundamental principles of emzed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Analysis workflows are *Python* scripts composing **emzed modules**.
   Single processing steps are explicit and clear which supports reproducible results.

2. We choose **Python** which makes programming with *emzed* as simple as possible.

3. In order to strengthen the trust in analysis results, emzed provides **interactive
   visualization** of input data, as well as inspection of intermediate and final results.

4. *emzed* ships with **emzed workbench** which is a integrated development environent (IDE) to
   support the use of *emzed modules* and the overall development process.
