Before you start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to use *emzed* for more than one user we recommend to provide a
shared folder, which can be accessed by all targeted users. We call this the
*global exchange folder*.  *emzed* will store databases, and *R* related code
there.

You can use *emzed* without such a folder.
